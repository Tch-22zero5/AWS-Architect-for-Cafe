The challenges in this project are built around a fictional business case. The business case provides a way to explore cloud-computing topics in the context of relatable business needs. This scenario is intended to provide an example of the real-world applicability of technical concepts that you will learn.Frank and Martha opened a café and bakery that had its start from a retirement dream. Frank and Martha were not yet ready to live out their retirement around the house. Instead, they wanted to do something that included their love of baking and supplemented their income. They enjoy interacting with the people in their neighborhood. They also like to support community events across town with their baked goods and coffees.To make their dreams a reality, Frank and Martha recently decided to open their café and bakery at the base of their flat. Their daughter, Sofía, and a local school student, Nikhil, help out and work at the café. Since they opened the café, they have experienced an increase in local business. They also sometimes receive inquiries from people who travel through the area either for business or as tourists.
